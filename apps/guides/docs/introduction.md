What is it?
====
DataZoomer is a web application platform that provides developers with an 
environment for quick application development, deployment and maintenance. It 
is easy to learn, uses a simple, effective approach to app development and 
offers flexibility for customization to meet most web development requirements.

DataZoomer's modular design and easy to use content management tools combine 
with its dynamic nature - making DataZoomer an ideal tool for rapid development of
applications, data visualizations and reports for highly interactive enterprise 
solutions.

In addition to aiding development, DataZoomer facilitates the continuous 
deployment, access control and ongoing operations of the applications optimizing 
the entire web application life-cycle.

Why another Python web application framework?
====
While many web application frameworks have been developed for Python, these
frameworks primarily fall into two camps.

1. minimalistic micro-frameworks for building quick and dirty web applications leaving most of the work to the developer, and; 
2. full-stack frameworks which take care of a lot of the details commonly required by web applications.

DataZoomer was built for developers.  While that may sound strange, since all
frameworks are created for developers, in using many of the existing frameworks
we found that they were either optimized for speed, or optimized for
scalability but none were optimized specifically for enterprise developer
productivity.

DataZoomer was designed to make it very easy to get something developed,
running and deployed very quickly.  This is it's sweet spot.  Because of this
it is great for prototyping and for rapid iterations.


How does it work?
====
DataZoomer assumes that everything is dynamic and changing.  It is
designed as a highly modular and extensible platform that provides as many
useful features for developers as it can without getting in the way.

Unlike most of the other frameworks which are designed as systems primarily
intended to run one main application, DataZoomer is a platform which designed
to run many different applications in the same system.  In fact, DataZoomer
comes bundled with numerous applications for commonly required tasks such as
content management, user management, security management and sytem management.


Enteprise Features?
====
DataZoomer was been developed from the ground up for the enterprise.
As such it comes with flexible authorization mechanisms, auditing and logging
tools, and the ability to grant access to based on roles.


Why the name DataZoomer?
====
DataZoomer was built primarily with data management and analysis in mind and as
such provides many tools useful for data processing including tools for viewing
tabular data, data visualization tools and a high speed data access layer.


About this Documentation
====
This documention provides reference information for DataZoomer developers and
administrators, including installation, configuration and customization of a
DataZoomer system.  It provides an informal introduction to the basic concepts
and features of DataZoomer and explains how to configure and customize the
system to meet individual needs. It helps to have a DataZoomer system installed
for hands-on experience.

Although DataZoomer is very easy to install and configure, it is recommended
that developers possess a good understanding of web technology, HTML, CSS,
the host operating system, and databases to go beyond a basic setup.

Please Note: This is not a comprehensive guide that covers every single
feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of
DataZoomer's most noteworthy features, and provides an idea of the system's
flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to configure and extend
DataZoomer, and you will be ready to learn more about the various DataZoomer
modules that make use of the DataZoomer system.
